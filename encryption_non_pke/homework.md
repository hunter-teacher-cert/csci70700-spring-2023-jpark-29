Decoding:

Encoding:

Substitution cipher algorithm:
 
1. Create a string variable that contains all letters in the English alphabets. 
2. Create another String variable that stores the shifted alphabet (the key)
3. Create a method that encodes the message
- Instantiate an empty String that holds the encoded message.
- Iterate through every character of the message 
- Check if the letter is in the String that holds the original alphabet
- If so, add the corresponding character from the key to the String that holds the encoded message.
